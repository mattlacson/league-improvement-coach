# League Improvement Coach Bot

## Overview
(Current champs supported: Jhin, Vayne, Jinx)

A personalized text-based chatbot designed to help League of Legends players improve by delivering rank-aware, champion-specific coaching and habit-focused guidance.

## Problem
Most League advice tools overwhelm players with stats or generic tips. Players struggle more with decision discipline, tilt, and knowing what to focus on game-to-game.

## Solution
This bot acts as a conversational improvement coach. It asks about a player’s rank, role, champion pool, and struggles, then produces a focused improvement plan rather than raw data.

## Features
- Rank-aware coaching
- Champion-specific advice (Jhin, Vayne, Jinx)
- “Next 10 Games” focus plans
- Post-game reflection prompts

## Sample Conversation
(you’ll paste the demo script here)

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Language: Python or JavaScript
- Interface: CLI / text-based
- Logic: Rule-based templates + AI-generated responses

## Limitations
- Limited champion pool
- No live Riot API integration
- Advice based on coaching heuristics, not game stats

## Future Improvements
- More champions and roles
- Matchup-specific advice
- Web interface
